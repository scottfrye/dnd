** Purpose **

I want to create a game similar to Nethack that uses the the Advanced Dungeon
and Dragons (1st Edition) rules.  The dungeon will be from the adventure
module The Temple of Elemental Evil.  The rule books and adventure modules are
included in PDF form and should be referenced when creating the game. 
The games should include all the areas in the adventure module including the dungeons, 
the towns of Hommlett and Nulb, the Keep and the Temple of Elemental Evil itself and all of it's dungeons.  
the details of play will be kept in log files. The dungeon and the towns will
change over time as described in the adventure module.  The different
leaders, while alive will continue recruiting new followers and occasionally
there will be battles between the different areas as the leaders of the areas
try to gain over their rivals.  The game
will have the capability to run without player characters and the non player
characters and dungeons will evolve.  The game will provide a way to
simulate these changes for long periods of time with or without player
characters.  The state of the dungeon will be available through admin commands
and human readable state files. The game will be entirely terminal based but
the gameplay will be abstracted enough to consider a different gui front end
in the future.  The code will be professional level quality and incorporate
best practices for software development at all levels, including documentations
and testing.
