created a command line version of Temple of Elemental Evil such that:
- it is a terminal game similar in appearance to rogue
- the game should use the Temple of Elemental Evil documenation follow
  with the 1st edition advanced dungeons and dragons rules.
- The rules and adventure details from the provided pdfs.
- The dungeon should include the outside areas described in the adventure
  module.
- The dungeon and the surrounding towns should be simulated to change over
  time and during the course of the advanture based on the rules in the
adventure module.  
- The simulatoin should be able to be run without playing the game with
  commands to display the status of the different areas.
- the project should be coded to allow other gui's to be used at a later date.
- functionality to created characters and to run play simulations with those
  characters as well as to run a game with a player.
- saved information about the state of the game or simulation should be
  available in human readable format.


I want to create a game similar to Nethack that uses the the Advanced Dungeon
and Dragons (1st Edition) rules.  The dungeon will be from the adventure
module The Temple of Elemental Evil.  The rule books and adventure modules are
included in PDF form and should be referenced when creating the game. 
The games should include all the areas in the adventure module including the dungeons, 
the towns of Hommlett and Nulb, the Keep and the Temple of Elemental Evil itself and all of it's dungeons.  
the details of play will be kept in log files. The dungeon and the towns will
change over time as described in the adventure module.  The different
leaders, while alive will continue recruiting new followers and occasionally
there will be battles between the different areas as the leaders of the areas
try to gain over their rivals.  The game
will have the capability to run without player characters and the non player
characters and dungeons will evolve.  The game will provide a way to
simulate these changes for long periods of time with or without player
characters.  The state of the dungeon will be available through admin commands
and human readable state files. The game will be entirely terminal based but
the gameplay will be abstracted enough to consider a different gui front end
in the future.  The project will be written in Python. The code will be professional level quality and incorporate
best practices for software development at all levels, including documentations
and testing.

The pdfs will not be in source control.
The project will be in a git repository with issues a kanban chart for tracking.
